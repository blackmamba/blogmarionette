Welcome to BlogMarionette!
===================



Intro
------
This is a basic Blog application example, built on Marionettejs (Backbone, underscore) & Bootstrap. It calls the rest api at port 3000. And the web application is running on port 8080. The REST apis are served using json-server (node based server, which reads from and writes to db.json - also included in the repo). Please feel free to clone/fork this repo and use/contribute as a starting template for your marionettejs application
